# The type of architecture used Model-View-Controller (MVC) 
Model-View-Controller (MVC) Offers many optimation as follow to make every development easy to handle.

1. Flexibility and Scalability: MVC supports modular development, making it easier to add new features or modify existing ones without disrupting the entire application.

2. Code Reusability: With clear separation between the Model, View, and Controller, each component can be reused in different parts of the application or in future projects. 

3. Testability: MVC facilitates unit testing and promotes better test coverage. Since each component has a clear responsibility, it    becomes easier to write unit tests for individual components. 

# MVC promotes the separation of concerns 
MVC divides the application into three distinct componentsModel, View, and Controller. Each component has a specific responsibility, which makes the codebase more modular, maintainable, and easier to understand.
